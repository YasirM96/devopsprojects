# Jenkins Pipeline Scripts for Web Application

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Jenkins Pipeline Scripts for Web Application repository! This repository provides you with ready-to-use Jenkins pipeline scripts to automate the build, test, and analysis processes for your web applications.

## Pipeline Overview

The Jenkins pipeline consists of the following stages:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Fetch Code') {
            // Fetch the latest source code of your web application
            // from the version control system (e.g., Git)
            steps {
                // Add your code-fetching steps here
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            // Compile and package your web application using Maven or Gradle
            steps {
                // Add your build steps here
            }
        }
        
        stage('Unit Testing') {
            // Run unit tests for your web application
            steps {
                // Add your unit testing steps here
            }
        }
        
        stage('Code Analysis') {
            // Perform static code analysis to ensure code quality
            steps {
                // Add your code analysis steps here
            }
        }
        
        stage('Quality Gate') {
            // Wait for a quality gate (e.g., SonarQube) to pass or fail
            steps {
                // Add your quality gate steps here
            }
        }
        
        stage('Artifact Upload') {
            // Upload the application artifact to a repository
            steps {
                // Add your artifact upload steps here
            }
        }
    }
}

1. **Install Jenkins**: Install and set up Jenkins on your machine or server.

2. **Create a New Pipeline Job**: Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.

3. **Configure Pipeline Script**: In the job configuration, copy the provided pipeline script and paste it into the pipeline script section.

4. **Customize the Pipeline**: Customize the pipeline stages and configurations to fit your web application project.

5. **Save and Run**: Save the job configuration and run the pipeline. Monitor the progress and logs in the Jenkins console.

## Notes

These pipeline scripts are intended for automating the build, test, and analysis processes of your web applications.

You can modify and extend the pipeline to include additional stages, such as integration testing, deployment, or any other specific requirements of your project.

Happy building and automating your web applications with Jenkins!
